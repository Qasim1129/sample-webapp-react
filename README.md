# **Snippod-Starter-Demo-App**

## Overview

A [**Snippod-Starter-Demo-App**](https://github.com/shalomeir/snippod-starter-demo-app) is a 'Full Stack Single Page Application' for the starter who want to be a web application developer.
We'd like to build this starter kit based on full stack single page web application architecture.
Snippod's architecture used a this kind of technology, **React + Flux (Redux) + django REST framewrok + RDBMS**.
[This stack](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ltVFRI_UMiSkhkenBGTEdmTUU/view?usp=sharing) is presented by diagram too.
